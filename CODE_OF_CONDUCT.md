# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (Summary)

This project seeks to provide a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free community for all contributors. All participants are expected to treat others with kindness and respect, and to follow these simple guidelines:

- Be friendly and patient.
- Be welcoming: help newcomers and assume good intent.
- Be respectful: no harassment, discrimination, or abusive language.
- Be collaborative: give constructive feedback and accept it graciously.

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this code of conduct, please report it to the maintainers by opening a private contact as described in `.github/SECURITY.md`.

This file is a short, local statement; you may opt to adopt a different formal code (for example the Contributor Covenant) â€” replace or expand this file if you prefer a full third-party text.
