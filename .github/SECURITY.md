# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository or the site it powers, please **do not** open a public issue.

Responsible disclosure steps

1. Contact the maintainers privately at: `glenster75@gmail.com`.
2. Provide a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any PoC code if available.
3. Allow the maintainers reasonable time to respond and remediate before publicly disclosing the issue.

If you cannot use email, you can open a private support ticket or create an encrypted message using the maintainers' PGP key (publish PGP fingerprint here if you add one).

Emergency contact

- If the issue is actively being exploited and requires immediate attention, follow up with a phone contact or maintainers' emergency channel (replace with your channel details).

After a fix

- The maintainers will coordinate a disclosure timeline and may publish a non-sensitive advisory once a patch is live.
